The following work is presented as a mostly as-is archive of a good chunk of my work from my time at Missouri Western State University 2014-2019, salvaged and incomplete compared to what its true last state was as time likes to work storage devices into the grave eventually.

Any sensitive details such as urls, apikeys, logins, etc. have been redacted.

There WILL be some with unfinished code, probably some silly comments.
This archive WILL lack some documentation that describes what each piece of code or work is designed to do or accomplish.
Some works will include older and sometimes outdated libraries that will likely pose some difficulty in getting some of these to compile, for example freeGLUT for some of the graphics programming in the C folder.

It is on my to-do list to go through each piece and better document each work, and additionally, to provide compiled versions of each work through cloud storage, which will be linked here later at an unspecified future date when I find time to clean this up.

As of the date of the commit of this readme, 11-20-24, that cleaning has not been done but under pressure to get a job after being laid off I am choosing to make this public at risk of any light embarassment I may face later.
