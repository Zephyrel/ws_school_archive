Create a card deck.  Assume a standard 52-card deck.

Your main() class should not be in a package.

You should have a package that represents a linked list.

You should create a package called Cards.  The package will have three classes plus the enumerated type for suits

Card Class represents a single card.  There are three data members

    Suit -- A public enumerated type
    Value a byte from 1 through 13 
    The unicode character for the card  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards_in_Unicode.  You could hard-code this, but you might figure out an algorithmic way to convert the suit and value directly into unicode.

Deck Class -- Basically the head of a linked list that holds cards.  Decks should preserve the order in which they are inserted.

Hand Class -- This is extended from a Class.   A hand holds an unknown number of cards, but they are in order by suit, and within the suit they are in order by value.
