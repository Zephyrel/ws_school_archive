Implement a scanner in Java for the language C-Minus. Refer to the C-Minus Compiler Project
(posted in the course materials folder) for the lexical conventions of C-Minus. An executable
jar file and some test files are provided for you to see what your program should do. You can
run the jar file using the command "java -jar "path-to-the-jar-file\HandCodedScanner.jar" to
test scanning the source code from command line interactively or 
"java -jar "path-to-the-jar-file\HandCodedScanner.jar -i inputfile" to test scanning the source code from a file.

Hope the following instructions give you some helpful hints.

1. Create an enum java file called CMinusTokens.java to hold c-minus token types.	//DONE

2. Create an enum java file called CMinusDFAStates.java to hold c-minus DFA states.	//DONE

3. Create a java class called CMinusDFA.java. This class contains the allowed character set,
	namely the alphabet, and the set of DFA states. It also should contain the transition table
	and a method to lookup the table based upon the current state and input char. 

4. Create a java file called CMinusScanner.java. The scanner contains an instance of the CMinusDFA
	and use it to identify the tokens from the characters read from a file or the command line.

5. Create a main java program to initialize an instance of CMinusScanner and allow the user to
	specify where to get the input source program, either from a file or from the command line.
	Then start scanning and display errors if any. 

Zip and submit your source code only. No jar file will be accepted. Whatever you submit will be
graded as is. No correction or update will be allowed after the deadline.
