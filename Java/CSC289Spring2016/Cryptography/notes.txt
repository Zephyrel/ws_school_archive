(Euclid’s Division Theorem)
Let n be a positive integer. Then for every integer m,
there exist unique integers q and r such that
m = nq + r and 0  r < n.

Modular Arithmetic
Definition (1st version);
Let m, n be positive integers. Then m mod n is the
remainder left when dividing m by n.
Ex: 25 mod 4 = 1; 25 mod 5 = 0; 27 mod 5 = 2.
We would like to extend this definition to negative m as well.
Definition (2nd version);
For an integer m and positive integer n,
m mod n is the smallest nonnegative integer r such that,
for some integer q, m = nq + r.
Ex: 25 mod 4 = 1; −25 mod 4 = 3.

Note: In general, except if [m mod n] = 0,
[(−m) mod n] = n − [m mod n] so
[(−m) mod n] != [m mod n] unless
[m mod n] = n/2.

Lemma 2.2
i mod n = (i + kn) mod n for all integers k.

Lemma 2.3
(i + j) mod n = (i + (j mod n)) mod n
= ((i mod n) + j) mod n
= ((i mod n) + (j mod n)) mod n,
(i · j) mod n = (i · (j mod n)) mod n
= ((i mod n) · j) mod n
= ((i mod n) · (j mod n)) mod n.

If x 2 Zn, then x is a variable with possible
integral values between 0 and n − 1.
• If x, y 2 Zn, we use x+n y and x·n y to perform
algebraic operations on x, y.
• Additive identity property: 0 +n i = i.
Multiplicative identity property: 1 ·n i = i.
• a −n b denotes a +n (−b).

Theorem 2.4
Addition and multiplication modn satisfy the
commutative, associative and distributive laws.
a +n (b +n c) = (a + (b +n c)) mod n
i+n j = (i+j) mod n and i ·n j = (i · j) mod n.
= (a + ((b + c) mod n)) mod n
= (a + (b + c)) mod n
= ((a + b) + c) mod n
= ((a + b) mod n + c) mod n
= ((a +n b) + c) mod n
= (a +n b) +n c

Private key is some a, n.
Encrypt: fa,n(M) = a ·M mod n = a ·n M
Decrypt: “Divide” f(M) by a mod n.
• In order for this to work division must exist and
define an inverse to multiplication., i.e.
ga,n(fa,n(M)) = M where ga,n(X) = a−1 ·n X
Does division exist?

When does fa,n(x) = a ·n x have an inverse?
fa,n(x) = a ·n x has an inverse if and only if
a and n are relatively prime, i.e., they have no
common factors greater than 1.

Positive integer m is a divisor of integer n
if n = mq for some integer q
• if m is a divisor of n we write m|n.
(say) “m divides n”
• if m is a not a divisor of n we write m 6 |n.
(say) “m does not divide n”

If p is a divisor of both m and n then
p is a common divisor of m and n
• gcd(m, n) denotes the greatest common divisor of m and n.
1 is aways a common divisor of m and n

Euclid’s Division Theorem
Theorem 2.12 (Euclid’s Division Theorem, Restricted
Version): Let n be a positive integer. Then
for every nonnegative integer m, there exist unique integers
q, r such that m = nq + r and 0  r < n.
Note 1: By definition, r = m mod n.
Note 2: This is restricted because we assume that
m is nonnegative. Book problem shows how to
extend this to negative m as well.

Before returning to multiplicative inverses, we first
see how to calculate gcd(j, k)
Suppose k = jq + r. Is there a relationship between
gcd(j, k) and gcd(r, j)?
Lemma 2.13 If j, k, q, and r are nonnegative integers
such that k = jq + r, then gcd(j, k) = gcd(r, j).
1)GCD(j, k) where 0  j < k
2)If j = 0 answer is k
3)Else
4)Write k = jq + r where r = k mod j
5)Answer is GCD(r, j)

Note that r is nonegative, and every time line 4 is executed,
r < j, so the value of r decreases. Therefore, in a finite
number of steps, process reaches j = 0 and terminates

Lemma 2.11: Given a and n, if there exist integers
x and y such that ax + ny = 1, then gcd(a, n) = 1
— that is, a and n are relatively prime.

Extended GCD Algorithm
Returns not only GCD of j, k with j < k but also
x, y such that gcd(j, k) = jx + ky.
(i) Base case: k = jq:
gcd(j, k) = j with x = 1, y = 0.
(ii) Nonbase case: k 6= jq so k = jq + r with 0 < r < j
Recursively compute gcd(r, j)
and x0, y0 s.t. gcd(r, j) = rx0 + jy0.
Because r = k − jq,
gcd(r, j) = (k − jq)x0 + jy0 = kx0 + j(y0 − qx0)
so gcd(j, k) = gcd(r, j) = jx + ky
where y = x0 and x = y0 − qx0.

Euclid’s extended GCD algorithm then gives
Theorem 2.14: Given two integers j, k, Euclid’s extended
GCD algorithm computes gcd(j, k) and two
integers x, y such that gcd(j, k) = jx + ky.
We can now extend Lemma 2.11 to
Theorem 2.15: Two positive integers j, k have
gcd(j, k) = 1 (and thus are relatively prime) if and
only if there are integers x, y such that jx + ky = 1.
Proof: “if” comes from Lemma 2.11
“only if” comes from Theorem 2.14

Recall
Lemma 2.8 The equation a ·n x = 1 has a solution in
Zn iff there exist integers x, y such that ax + ny = 1.
Combining this and Theorem 2.15 gives
Corollary 2.16: For any positive integer n, a 2 Zn
has a multiplicative inverse iff gcd(a, n) = 1.
Using the fact that if n is prime, gcd(a, n) = 1 for all
nonzero a 2 Zn, we obtain
Corollary 2.17: For any prime p, every nonzero
a 2 Zp has a mutiplicative inverse.

Computing Inverses
Corollary 2.18: If an element a 2 Zn has an inverse,
we can compute it by running Euclid’s extended GCD
algorithm to determine integers x, y so that ax+ny = 1.
The inverse of a 2 Zn is x mod n.
Example: Given a = 27, n = 58 we can use the
Extended GCD algorithm to find that
27(−15) + 58(7) = 1.
Thus the multiplicative inverse of 27 in Z58 is
−15 mod 58 = 43.
Reality check: 27 · 43 = 1161 = 20 · 58 + 1

Definition:
Zn is the set of integers {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} with
addition modn i +n j = (i + j) mod n and
multiplication modn i ·n j = (i · j) mod n

Lemma 2.20 Let p be a prime number. For any nonzero
number a 2 Zp, the function fa(x) = x ·p a is 1-to-1. In
particular, the numbers, 1 ·p a, 2 ·p a, . . . , (p − 1) ·p a ,
are a permutation of the set {1, 2, . . . , p − 1}.

For public-key cryptography,
the public encoding function, PB, needs to be one-way.
The secret decoding function, SB, is actually
an efficient way of calculating the inverse of PB.
This efficient way is only available to the
“owner” who constructed PB.

Exponentiation in Zn is the main idea behind RSA encryption:
By Lemma 2.3, if a 2 Zn, then
aj mod n = |a ·n a ·n{z· · · ·n a} .
j factors
aj mod n is the product in Zn of j factors, each equal to a.

Lemma 2.19:
For any a 2 Zn and any nonnegative integers i, j,
(ai mod n) ·n (aj mod n) = ai+j mod n
(ai mod n)j mod n = aij mod n
