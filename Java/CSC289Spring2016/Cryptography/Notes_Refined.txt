Part 1 - Modulus Operator and Arithmetic
===================================================================
First, we must explain the modulo operators and they're properties.
Properties of modulo.
In mathematical equations, a "." denotes a subscript.
A subscript is the tiny meaningful numbers or letters
at the foot of a variable, operator, or symbol.
ε, lower-case epsilon, ALT code 238, denotes "element of"
Z.n is the set of all integers from 0 to n.

== Shorthand for Multiplication and Addition modulo. ==
i +.n j	= (i + j) mod n and i *.n j = (i * j) mod n.

== Definition (1st version) ==
Let m, n be positive integers. Then m mod n is the
remainder left when dividing m by n.
Ex: 25 mod 4 = 1; 25 mod 5 = 0; 27 mod 5 = 2.
We would like to extend this definition to negative m as well.

== Definition (2nd version) ==
For an integer m and positive integer n,
m mod n is the smallest nonnegative integer r such that,
for some integer q, m = nq + r.
Ex: 25 mod 4 = 1; −25 mod 4 = 3.

Note: In general, except if [m mod n] = 0,
[(−m) mod n] = n − [m mod n] so
[(−m) mod n] != [m mod n] unless
[m mod n] = n/2.

i mod n = (i + kn) mod n for all integers k.



(Euclid’s Division Theorem)
Let n be a positive integer. Then for every integer m,
there exist unique integers q and r such that
m = nq + r and 0 <= r < n.

Addition and multiplication mod n satisfy the
commutative, associative and distributive laws.
(i + j) mod n	= (i + (j mod n)) mod n
				= ((i mod n) + j) mod n
				= ((i mod n) + (j mod n)) mod n,
(i * j) mod n 	= (i * (j mod n)) mod n
				= ((i mod n) * j) mod n
				= ((i mod n) * (j mod n)) mod n.
a +.n (b +.n c) = (a + (b +.n c)) mod n
				= (a + ((b + c) mod n)) mod n
				= (a + (b + c)) mod n
				= ((a + b) + c) mod n
				= ((a + b) mod n + c) mod n
				= ((a +n b) + c) mod n
				= (a +.n b) +.n c
				
If x ε Z.n, then x is a variable with possible
integral values between 0 and n − 1.
	>If x, y ε Z.n, we use x +.n y and x *.n y to perform
		algebraic operations on x, y.
	>Additive identity property: 0 +.n i = i.
		Multiplicative identity property: 1 *.n i = i.
	>a −.n b denotes a +.n (−b).

Part 2 - Inverses and Greatest Common Divisors
========================================================
== Expressing Divisors ==
Positive integer m is a divisor of integer n
if n = mq for some integer q
	if m is a divisor of n we write m | n.
		(say) “m divides n”
	if m is a not a divisor of n we write m /| n.
		“m does not divide n”
		
If p is a divisor of both m and n then p is a common divisor of m and n
	gcd(m, n) denotes the greatest common divisor of m and n.
	1 is aways a common divisor of m and n

== Euclid Division Theorem, Restricted Version ==
Let n be a positive integer. Then for every nonnegative
integer m, there exist unique integers
q, r such that m = nq + r and 0 <= r < n.
	Note 1: By definition, r = m mod n.
	Note 2: This is restricted because we assume that
		m is nonnegative. Book problem shows how to
		extend this to negative m as well.

For every m, there is some pair q and r that satisfying m.
We must also show that the pairs q and r are unique for every m
Suppose that m = nq + r and m = nq' + r' with 0 <= r < n
and 0 <= r' < n.
0 = n(q − q') + r − r'	=>	n(q − q') = r' − r.
|r'−r| < n				=>	|n(q−q')| = |r'−r| < n.
Because n is a factor of the left side, the only way the inequality
can hold is if |n(q − q')| = |r' − r| = 0.
Therefore, q = q' and r = r',
proving that q and r satisfying m are unique.		

== Euclid's Greatest Common Divisor Algorithm ==
=================================================
If j, k, q, and r are nonnegative integers
such that k = jq + r, then gcd(j, k) = gcd(r, j).
=================================================
Before getting to multiplicative inverses, we first
see how to calculate gcd(j, k)
Suppose k = jq + r. Is there a relationship between
gcd(j, k) and gcd(r, j)?

Proof 1:
r = 0:
Then gcd(r, j) = j since every number divides 0.
But k = jq so gcd(k, j) = j = gcd(j, r)
and we are done.

Proof 2:
r > 0:
Let (d) be a common factor of (j, k)
	{k = (i.1)d} and {j = (i.2)d} for some nonnegative (i.1, i.2).
	d is a factor of {r = k − jq = (i.1 − (i.2)q)d}
Let d be a common factor of (j, r)
	j = i2d and r = i3d for some nonnegative i2, i3.
	d is a factor of k = jq + r = (i2q + i3)d
So d is a common factor of [j, k] iff (if and only if) d is a common factor of r, j
	d = gcd(j, k) iff d = gcd(r, j)
==================================================

GCD(j, k) where 0 <= j < k
	If j = 0 answer is k
	Else
		Write k = jq + r where r = k mod j
		Answer is GCD(r, j)
		
Note that r is nonegative, and every time line 4 is executed,
r < j, so the value of r decreases. Therefore, in a finite
number of steps, process reaches j = 0 and terminates

== Multiplicative Inverse ==

If a has multiplicative inverse {a' ε Z.n},
then for any {b ε Zn}, the equation {a *.n x = b} has the
solution {x = a' *.n b}, and this solution is unique.

Proof:
If a has inverse a' ε Zn and (*) a·nx = b

Given a, to decide whether a *.n x = b has a
unique solution in Zn, it helps to know whether
a has a multiplicative inverse in Z.n.

Given a and n, if there exist integers
x and y such that ax + ny = 1, then gcd(a, n) = 1
— that is, a and n are relatively prime.

Computing Inverses:
Corollary 2.18: If an element a ε Z.n has an inverse,
we can compute it by running Euclid’s extended GCD
algorithm to determine integers x, y so that ax+ny = 1.
The inverse of a ε Z.n is x mod n.
