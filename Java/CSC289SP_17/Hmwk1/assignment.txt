Use JFlex to create a pattern recognizer for email and IP addresses.
The common email domain suffixes should be identified such as .com, .org, .gov, .mil, .net, etc.
An IP address is composed of 4 octets separated by dots. Each octet could be 1-3 digit long within range [0-255].

Submit your JFlex input file and a source file to test your scanner.

/* IP ADDRESS
* Format is 4 octets (0-255) seperated by .'s
* i.e XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX and X.X.X.X are both valid
*/


/*	EMAIL ADDRESS
*	Format:	name@domain.toplevelsuffix
*
