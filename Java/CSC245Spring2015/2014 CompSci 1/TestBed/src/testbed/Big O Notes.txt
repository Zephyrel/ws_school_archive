Big O Notation

Big O notation tells us how a function will scale(runtime)
	As we offer larger and larger databases to an algorithm, how does it scale timewise?
		
int a[30], b[30], count=0;
for(int i=0;i<=29;i++){
	for(int j=0;j<=29;j++{
		if(a[i]==b[j])count++;
	}
}
Big O for this would be O(n^2)
Loops sre multiplicative and on the order of n
Statements such as if's, increments, and assignments are constant
