Lets write a trivial little program in Java to learn some things about networking.

Specifically I'd like to know the IP address given a DNS name, the port of that website, the local IP address of the user computer, and the port of the local computer.

Brief sketch of what we need to do:

Import two packages that will provide code we need for hosts and ports. Those are java.io.* and java.net.*.

 We need to open a socket, which is simply a connection point for the remote computer. We might name it, eh, mySocket), and a _sketch_ of the code might be something like

...Socket mySocket.....new...host...DNS name...port...

and we'll use REDACTED and port 80.

The methods that are provided by the two imported package that we will need will be...........?

That correctly written code should return something like:

Connection to: REDACTED/XX.XXX.X.XXX
Port Number: 80

You'll need to put the text into a println statement, of course.

Then for the localhost something similar.  Sample output:

Local Address: /XX.XX.XX.XXX
Local Port: XXXXX

We shold also implement some error handling, a try-catch block would be nice, since I will modify your source code to try obviously bad websites.
The handle the cases where there is an unknown host, a bad socket, or an I/O exception.

At the top of the output give me your info: Name, Class, and Network Programming Assignment #1.

The assignment will not be due until 26 September, so we can discuss it in class before then.
