F = MS{T}/MS{R}
E(MS{T}) = δ + E(of i) n{i}(µ^2)

t = µ{i} - µ{j}/(sqrt^(ô^2(1/n{i}+1/n{j}))

Bon Feroni approach
The probability of a Type I error is the significance level a. But if multiple tests e.g., m comparisons) are to be made the probability of at least one Type I error increases to a probability of 1.0-(1-a)^m.
ex. if 3 comparisons are made each with a = .05 thn the probability of at least one Type 1 error
is equal to 1.0-(0.95)^3 ~= 0.143

To avoid this higher probability, we may choose to use an adjusted significance level of a/m for each test, where m is the total number of comparisons made
