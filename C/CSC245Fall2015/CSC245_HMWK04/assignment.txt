Read the 128-byte ID3v1 tag at the end of the an MP3 file and print out the data.  (Overachievers can do the ID3v3 tag at the beginning of the file).  

You can read about ID3v1 tags at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3

You should make a struct that will hold the data from the tag.  It is up to you whether it holds the "TAG" field itself.
The struct will contain a union for the one field that can either hold 30 of comment or 28 characters of comment and 2 bytes of numerical data.
Your struct should be in a module consisting of a .h and a .cpp file.  The struct should be accompanied by any utility methods.
At a minimum there should be two functions.

    A "readTag" method that accepts a file name, moves to the -128 position in the file and then does a binary read of the entire tag at the same time.
    A "printTag" method that prints the fields of the tag.  The read method will have to deal with the arrays of characters because they are not necessarily null-terminated.  

Not all mp3 files have ID3v1 tags, but your program should manage any of them that do.  One sample file is provided, but you should find some others to test.
